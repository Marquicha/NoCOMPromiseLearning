# No COMPromised Learning

## Despriction: 

Many schools in these unserved areas have little to no C.S education implemented into their curriculums. In todayâ€™s world where we know that technology and data play such large part into our everyday lives, it is kind of wild to imagine that any school system could be lacking in this education. However, we are still struggling to effectively expose many children to these particular studies. Which in turns, plays a role in the lack thereof of this demographic having a much less footprint, involvement, or voice in the computer science (tech) industry, which career median salary is $38,640 greater than other occupations according to Applied Computing University of Wisconsin. Computer science education should be exposed to students in grade levels starting at kindergarten, so that by high school grade level students would have a been groomed in certain concepts. No COMPromise Learning will be a seamless, creative, effective way to have students open to the endless possibilities that a career in the tech industry can offer and provides many of the required pieces of the Pennsylvania Learning Standard.
